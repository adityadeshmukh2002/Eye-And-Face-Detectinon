# Eye-And-Face-Detection

Eye and face detection is a popular application of computer vision that involves detecting and locating human faces and eyes in digital images or video streams. This task can be accomplished using Python and the OpenCV library.

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library that contains several pre-trained classifiers for detecting facial features. These classifiers are based on Haar cascades, which are trained to detect specific features such as eyes, nose, mouth, and face.
